# You must pick an auth style from the following two:
# authStyle=local
#    this is for email based authentication where users specify a password
# authStyle=ldap
#    this is for authenticating against an LDAP server
authStyle=local

#The baseURL is the address of the server FROM THE USER perspective
#If you are working through a firewall or reverse proxy which change the
#address, then set here the EXTERNAL view of that address.
#Include slash on end.
baseURL=http://kswenson4-t902.corp.fc.local:8080/ssofi/

#set rootURL to the URL base address of the application as seen on this 
#actual server. This setting is necessary to recognize OpenID values 
#when you have a proxy configured to rewrite URL addresses. 
#If you don't have a proxy then this will be the same as baseURL.
#Include slash on end.
rootURL=http://kswenson4-t902.corp.fc.local:8080/ssofi/

#if sessionFolder is set, then the session information will be stored
#in files in that folder.  For cluster, set this folder to be a shared drive
#sessionFolder=/opt/SSOFI_Sessions

#Set the logged in session duration.  This sets the duration of the cookie
#sent to the browser in seconds.  2500000 is about 1 month.
