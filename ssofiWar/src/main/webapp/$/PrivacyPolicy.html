<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><b>Single Sign-On Federated Identity</b> (a.k.a. <b>SSOFI</b>) is an identify server for the purpose of allowing you to log into applications and to maintain your password.  SSOFI is open source software and the exact policy is up to the organization that makes the SSOFI server available to the public.</p>

<p>The SSOFI server hosted at circleweaver.com is provided by Circle Weaver Tech LLC, which is committed to respecting your privacy and protecting your personal information.</p>

<ul>
<li>We will be transparent about the information we are collecting and what we will do with it.</li>
<li>We will use the information you give us for the purposes described in our Privacy Policy, which include providing you with services you have requested and enhancing your experience with Circle Weaver.</li>
<li>We will also use the information to help us understand you better and so that we can give you relevant offers.</li>
<li>If you tell us, you donâ€™t want to receive marketing messages we will stop sending them.  We will, of course, continue to send essential information relating to a product or service you have purchased to keep you informed about your sites.</li>
<li>We will put in place measures to protect your information and keep it secure.</li>
<li>We will respect your data protection rights and aim to give you control over your own information.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can access our full Privacy Policy below to help you to understand better how we use your personal information. In it, we explain in more detail the types of personal information we collect, how we collect it, what we may use it for and who we may share it with.</p>

<h1>The Short Version</h1>

<p>SSOFI is an identity server, which means that its purpose is to prove who you are to an application that relies on it.  You log into it using an email address and a password which you set up.  You can also provide a full name for user-friendly screen labeling.  Once you log in, the SSOFI server will use a cookie to remember who you are the next time you access it.  As you access applications that rely on SSOFI, the application will interact with SSOFI and in doing so be given your email address and name in a reliable manner.  This is given only to applications that you access, and only when you are logged in.  Your information (email address and name) is never provided to anyone else for any purpose other than proving who you are when you access a relying application.</p>

<p>Note: SSOFI is a completely different server from the application you are trying to log into.  The application that uses SSOFI may have a different privacy policy than this one.  This privacy policy is purely for the SSOFI identity server which allows you to log in to authenticate yourself to other applications.</p>

<p>Of course, the short version doesn't tell you everything, so please read on for more details!</p>

<hr/>
<h1>Privacy Policy Details</h1>

<p>Any personal information processed by SSOFI in connection with this Privacy Policy is controlled by Circle Weaver Tech LLC, which is considered the "data controller" of your personal information under applicable data protection law. </p>

<p>Personal information means details which identify you or could be used to identify you, such as your name and your email address.</p>


<hr/>
<h2>Required Information</h2>

<h3>Email Address</h3>

<p>All participants are required to provide an email address as a globally unique ID for who you are.  An email is sent to that email address first to verify that you own the email address.  Later, you can request an email be sent in order to set or change your password.  You email address is passed to the relying application in order to identify you from all other people.</p>

<p>If you wish to use SSOFI without your personal email address being seen by others, you are encouraged to obtain and use a email address from a free or low cost supplier, like GMail or competitor to use as a unique ID and as a way to receive communications from SSOFI.  If you are not able to find a suitable vendor for this, an obfuscated email address can be provided for a reasonable charge not to exceed $15/month by making a written request to Circle Weaver Tech LLC.</p>

<h3>Full Name</h3>

<p>Each user provides a full name which is used as a label to be used on screen to indication actions you have taken within the relying applications.</p>

<p>If you don't want to use your real name, you are allowed to enter an alias.  You can set your name to be any value that you wish, and that will be the name that others in the system will identify you as.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>Cookies are a technology feature of a browser that allows you to be identified across multiple requests.  As you log in, a cookie is set. That value indicates that the request comes from the same browser that you used to log in, and so the request is identified as coming from you.</p>

<p>Cookies are also given to the browser to save the login id that you have used in the past, simply as a convenience to make it easier to log in the next time you visit.</p>

<p>You may clear your cookies at any time, but you will lose your current logged in session, and you will not be allowed access any new relying applications until you log in again.  Disabling cookies will defeat the ability of the identity server to function.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Non-Collected Information</h2>

<p>SSOFI does not request any sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information.</p>

<p>If you're a child under the age of 13, you may not have an account on SSOFI. SSOFI does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will unfortunately have to close your account. Other countries may have different minimum age limits, and if you are below the minimum age for providing consent for data collection in your country, you may not use Circle Weaver without obtaining your parents' or legal guardians' consent.</p>

<h2>Aggregated Information</h2>

<p>We do share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use SSOFI. For example, we may compile statistics on the patterns of login to be used to estimate when a server might have to be enhanced. However, we do not sell this information to advertisers or marketers.</p>

<hr/>
<h1>Compelled Disclosure</h1>


<p>Circle Weaver Tech LLC may disclose personally-identifying information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement in response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.</p>

<p>In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, Circle Weaver Tech strives for transparency. When permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances.</p>


<hr/>
<h1>Removal From the System</h1>

<p>We offer you simple methods of accessing and correcting the User Personal Information we have collected.  You can change what you have provided for name at any time.  To change email, you will need to create a new account under the new email address.</p>

<p>Any user may have their personal information removed from the system by making a written request to Circle Weaver Tech LLC and include the specific email address of the account you wish purged.</p>
